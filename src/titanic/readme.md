# Titanic AI Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes information on passengers who were on board the Titanic during its tragic voyage.

## Features

- PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Cross-validation is employed to ensure the robustness of the model.
